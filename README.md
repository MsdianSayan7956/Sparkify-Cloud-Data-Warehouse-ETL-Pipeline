# Sparkify-Cloud-Data-Warehouse-ETL-Pipeline
This project builds an ETL pipeline for Sparkify, a music streaming startup, to migrate their data processing to the cloud. The pipeline extracts data from JSON files in Amazon S3, stages it in Amazon Redshift, and transforms it into a star schema optimized for analytics on song plays.
